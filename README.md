## Yo! I'm building this for my upcoming Strava Interview.
## I feel the best way to prepare for the interview is to re-create as much of the Strava backend as I can.
## There will be 4-5 stages of this entire 2 day coding sprint:
### STAGE 1: Creating a server, and services to handle CRUD of athlete data 
### STAGE 2: Creating a server, and service to handle CRUD of athelete activity data. Processing of data and storing the basic metrics.
### STAGE 3: Creating a club leader board service. Assuming every athlete in the club is in the same club.
### STAGE 4: Creating a segment leader board service. I will also attempt to code the entire local legend service as part of this to test myself more. This state is going to be the hardest.
### STAGE 5: Adding the use of REDIS everywhere, to improve the system performance.

Other changes if time permits: Scalibility, dockerise it, connect it to my already existing micro frontend, create a load balancer, create an activtity feed service - we already have this code mainly filtering from the other mock strava project..
